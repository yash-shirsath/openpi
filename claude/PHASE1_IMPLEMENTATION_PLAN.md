```

## 1. Performance Benchmarking Suite

### 1.1 Benchmark Configurations
From the plan document, we'll test:
- **Sequence Lengths**: [512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192]
- **Batch Sizes**: [1, 4, 8, 16] 
- **Head Configurations**: [(32, 32), (32, 8)] # (num_heads, num_kv_heads)

### 1.2 Target Implementations
We need to benchmark both existing attention implementations:
- `src/openpi/models/gemma.py:150-242` (Attention class)
- `src/openpi/models/gemma_fast.py:125-225` (Attention class)

### 1.3 Metrics to Collect
- **Wall-clock time**: Forward pass, backward pass (if training)
- **Throughput**: Tokens/second, batches/second
- **Memory efficiency**: Peak memory usage, memory vs sequence length
- **Hardware utilization**: GPU memory bandwidth, compute utilization

## 2. Memory Benchmarking Framework

### 2.1 Memory Tracking
- Peak memory usage during attention computation
- Memory scaling with sequence length (O(n²) vs O(n))
- KV cache memory impact and efficiency
- Memory fragmentation analysis

### 2.2 JAX-Specific Considerations
Since this is a JAX codebase, we need to account for:
- XLA compilation overhead (separate from runtime)
- JAX memory management and device arrays
- JIT compilation impact on memory patterns

## 3. Correctness Testing Framework

### 3.1 Numerical Precision Tests
- Compare outputs between standard and flash attention (when implemented)
- Gradient equivalence testing for training stability
- Numerical stability across different sequence lengths
- Determinism validation (same inputs → same outputs)

### 3.2 Integration Tests
- Full model forward pass comparison
- KV cache functionality preservation 
- RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) compatibility
- Grouped Query Attention (GQA) support validation

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Current Attention Analysis
Both attention implementations use:
- einsum-based attention: `jnp.einsum("BTKGH,BSKH->BKGTS", q, k)`
- Softmax with masking: `jax.nn.softmax(masked_logits, axis=-1)`
- Value aggregation: `jnp.einsum("BKGTS,BSKH->BTKGH", probs, v)`

### 4.2 Key Integration Points
- RoPE application: `_apply_rope(q/k, positions=positions)`
- KV caching: Different mechanisms in gemma.py vs gemma_fast.py
- Multi-head/Multi-KV-head support: GQA with head grouping
- LoRA integration: Custom einsum operations with LoRA configs

## 5. Benchmark Execution Strategy

### 5.1 Automated Testing
- Parameterized tests across all configuration combinations
- Statistical significance: Multiple runs with mean/std reporting
- Warmup runs to account for XLA compilation
- Resource cleanup between tests

### 5.2 Hardware Profiling
- GPU memory bandwidth utilization
- Compute vs memory bound analysis
- Scaling behavior analysis (linear, quadratic, etc.)

## 6. Expected Deliverables

### 6.1 Benchmark Reports
- Performance comparison tables
- Memory usage scaling charts
- Correctness validation results
- Hardware utilization analysis

### 6.2 Baseline Establishment
- Current performance baselines for both implementations
- Memory usage patterns documentation
- Identified performance bottlenecks
- Recommendations for flash attention integration points

## 7. Success Criteria

### 7.1 Performance Baselines
- Comprehensive performance profiles for existing attention
- Clear identification of memory bottlenecks
- Quantified scaling behavior with sequence length

### 7.2 Correctness Framework
- Robust numerical comparison framework
- Automated correctness validation pipeline
- Integration test suite covering all model variants

### 7.3 Infrastructure Readiness
- Reusable benchmarking infrastructure
- Automated reporting and visualization
- Ready for Phase 2 flash attention comparison

## Next Steps After Phase 1

Once benchmarking infrastructure is complete:
1. Establish performance baselines for current implementations
2. Document scaling behavior and bottlenecks
3. Identify optimal sequence length thresholds for flash attention
4. Prepare for Phase 2: Flash attention library evaluation and integration

This infrastructure will be critical for validating that flash attention improvements are real and don't introduce regressions.
